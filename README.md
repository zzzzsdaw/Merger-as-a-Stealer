# Merger-as-a-Stealer: Stealing Targeted PII from Aligned LLMs with Model Merging
This project is the official open-source content for the paper "Merger-as-a-Stealer: Stealing Targeted PII from Aligned LLMs with Model Merging" submitted to ACL 2025. The paper reveals a security vulnerability in the model merging process, where malicious mergers can extract targeted Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) through model merging, and proposes a corresponding attack framework, Merger-as-a-Stealer.

## Adopted PII Datasets

**Enron PII**: A publicly available dataset containing 3,333 non - Enron data subjects, each with a name and email pair. It is commonly used to evaluate PII leakage. In this project, it is used to construct the expert dataset and evaluate the attack effectiveness under different experimental settings.

**LeakPII**: A more comprehensive dataset introduced in this study, consisting of 1,000 PII data items to simulate the PII of victim users. Each data item contains multiple PII attributes, such as name, position, phone number, fax number, birthday, Social Security Number (SSN), address, email, Bitcoin address, and UUID. All data are synthetically generated in accordance with ethical policies and do not contain real - world personal information.

## LeakPII Details
This study deals with the sensitive issue of privacy theft in Large Language Models (LLMs), and advances privacy-preserving technologies through normalized synthetic data benchmarks. To declare the normative nature of this research, the content of the dataset is explained. Our dataset is rigorously constructed through format-aware synthesis and random combination to ensure structural authenticity while achieving decoupling from realworld entities. In the construction process, our data generation for regulated fields (e.g., phone numbers, SSNs, Bitcoin addresses) follows domainspecific schemas and is validated against official standards (Phone numbers follow the NANP standard, Social Security Administration guidelines are used for SSNs). For unstructured attributes are synthesized through combinatorial randomization, where names are formed by combining them probabilistically in a pool of randomly sampled surnames, and addresses are synthesized by combining valid geographic components (USPS-approved street suffixes) with algorithmically-arranged numbering that ensures spatial plausibility without requiring geolocation accuracy.

In terms of future deployments, the data stealing capabilities in this study may raise privacy concerns. We advocate responsible deployment practices to protect user data. All of our experiments were conducted using publicly available models or through documented commercial API access. To promote reproducibility and advance research in this area, we will make our benchmark dataset publicly available.

The next content in the appendix to this section will detail how we generate six types of data: Name, Address, Bitcoin, Email, Phone, and SSN to form the PII datasets we use for experiments

**Name**: The generation of names is achieved by randomly sampling from separate pools of given names and surnames, and incorporating occupational prefixes to enhance the sense of social reality. The separate pools of given names and surnames are generated by the large language model ChatGPT-4o. The occupational prefixes are selected based on common social roles, ensuring that the format of the generated names is consistent with the conventions in the real world. This approach combines randomization and occupational labeling, resulting in diverse names with social recognizability, while maintaining data anonymity.

**Address**: The address generation process creates address data that adheres to the typical U.S. address format. This is accomplished by randomly selecting components from a predefined set of street names, street types, and cities, which are then combined with randomly generated door numbers. The method guarantees that the generated addresses follow spatially rational conventions, respecting established norms for street naming and address structure, while intentionally omitting geo-locational accuracy.

**Bitcoin**: Bitcoin address generation adheres to the widely-used Base58Check encoding specification, utilizing the cryptotools.net encryption tool for its creation. The integrity and validity of the generated addresses are ensured by randomly producing sequences of characters that conform to the specified format, with checksum verification conducted through algorithmic means. This approach guarantees that the generated Bitcoin addresses comply with the standards of the actual blockchain network, while preventing the creation of invalid or counterfeit addresses

**Email**: Email addresses are generated by randomly selecting a suffix from a pool of commonly used email domains and combining the chosen name with a randomly generated sequence of digits, ranging from four to six digits in length. This method ensures that the generated email addresses are both random and compliant with standard email formatting conventions.

**Phone**: Phone numbers are generated as hyphenseparated 10-digit sequences, ensuring compliance with the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). Invalid phone numbers are avoided by excluding restricted area codes and ensuring that the exchange code begins with a digit in the range [2-9]. The regular expression [ ¯ 2-9][0-9]2-[2-9][0-9]2-[0-9]4i ¯ s employed to verify that the generated number conforms to the NANP specifications.

**SSN**: The generation of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) follows the standard SSN format. A regular expression (?:( ¯ ?:0[1-9][0-9]|00[1-9]|[1-5][0-9]2|6[ 0-5][0-9]|66[0-5789]|7[0-2][0-9]|73[0-3] |7[56][0-9]|77[012])-(?:0[1-9]|[1-9][0-9 ])-(?:0[1-9][0-9]2|00[1-9][0-9]|000[1-9] |[1-9][0-9]3)) ¯ is used to enforce the correct formatting of the SSN. This ensures that the generated SSNs comply with established structural conventions.

## Evaluation Codes

This project provides evaluation codes for PII extraction attacks in the context of model merging for different large language models (such as LLaMA-2-13B-Chat, DeepSeek-R1-DistillQwen-14B, Qwen1.5-14B-Chat, etc.). The codes implement support for different attack settings (such as Naive and Practical), different model merging algorithms (such as Slerp and Task Arithmetic), and different evaluation metrics (such as Exact Match, Memorization Score, Prompt Overlap).
